# Trickerion-Trick-Selector

Ver1.0
This html+javascript page shows which components you still need (and their total cost) for each trick, based on your current stock (set at the top of the page). Updates automatically as you alter which components you own.

It uses graphics culled from the rulebook pdf.

Currently lacks action point cost to prepare, number of uses per prep and bonuses for level 36 tricks. It also shows basic components first, which is opposite to the Magician Workbook. Could do with sorting, filtering and better css (it fits fine on my laptop, but will turn to mush if given too narrow a window).
